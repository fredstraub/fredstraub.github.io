This was the final project for ICS 111.  It was our only group project inthe class, and the first groups project i had as an ICS student.  The drum machine was written in Java using the EZ.java library.  We used Ecllipse to run our app, but more importantly we succeded as a team in finishing with a project that met our design objectives.
